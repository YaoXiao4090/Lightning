# **Description**
    The project is to create a very simple version of the 1990 arcade game Raiden in a space setting using pygame.

# **Features**
- The game is a horizontal scrolling shooter scrolling to the right of the screen.  
- The screen has a background image of space.  
- Music plays in the background
- It has a player character which uses the image of Raiden MK-II.  
- Players are able to control the character to move in four directions with w,s,a,d.  
- players are able to fire projectiles with j.  
- There are enemies that move towards the player and shoot projectile directly forward.  
- The enemies share the same image that is different than the player.    
- Projectiles damage both player ship and enemy ships in contact.  
- Players score points for defeating enemies
- Players have 3 health and enemies have 1

# **Files**
All the files contained in the repository are sprite sheets and images files for the game assets, including player, enemy, background, explosion effect, and health.

# **Design considerations**
The biggest design consideration is using the Raiden sprite sheet for the player and bullets, and small MK-II image for the health indication.

# **Areas of improvements**
- The visual
- Player mechanic
- enemy variety
- working menus
