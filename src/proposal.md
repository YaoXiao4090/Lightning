# **Description**
    The project is to create a very simple version of the 1990 arcade game Raiden in a space setting using pygame.

# **Features**
- The game is going to be a horizontal scrolling shooter scrolling to the right of the screen.  
- The screen will have a background image of space.  
- It is going to have a player character which will be an image of a space ship.  
- Players will be able to control the character to move in four directions with w,s,a,d.  
- players will be able to fire projectile with j.  
- There will be enemies that move in random patterns and shoot projectile directly forward.  
- The enemies will have different images of space ship than the player.  
- There will be astroids in random sizes that fly top-down or bottom-up.  
- Projectiles will destroy both player ship and enemy ships in contact.  
- Astroids can't be destroyed and will destroy the player ship in contact.  
- Players will score points for defeating enemies

# **Challenges**
I will need to research:  
- How to add images to the surface.  
- How to add timer for spawning enemies.  
- How to add UI in pygame and create interactive buttons.  
- How to accurately trace an image to the surface.  
- How to detect images overlapping each other.

# **Outcomes**

## **Ideal Outcome**
The ideal outcome is to make a game that has endless waves of enemies and obstacles for players to defeat and score points.

## **Minimal Viable Outcome**
The minimal visable outcome is to have player fight a single strong enemy with stages added to the move and attack pattern.

# **Milestones**
- First week, create UI and background image.  
- Second week, create player character and projectiles.  
- Third week, create enemies and astroids.  
- Fourth week, implement defeat, scoring, and enemy wave mechanic.
